   * For loop = measure multiple values and take average, load cells are noisy by default.
   * calibration ADC = Ratio of how much the internal voltage is off from 5.00V
   * sensorValue = measured voltage on the pin, within 0...1023
   * maxADC = 1023, since we are using 10-bit analog to digital converter
   * refADV = expected ADC voltage of 5.00V
   * LoadCellLine_K = mapping from voltage to Newtons. Includes calibration values
   * LoadCellLine_B = mapping from voltage to Newtons. Includes calibration values
   * Newtons = K * Voltage + B
